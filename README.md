# Vite React Unit Testing
Using node 20.11.1
This project uses typescript

## Jest
Currently using jest

## axe-core
dequelabs has sunsetted axe-core/react (it will not work with react 18+), so this is why we're using just the axe-core module. There is a future project planned for a react 18+ tool but this has not been released yet.

## Use tsx NOT ts-node
ts-node is broken in crazy ways, tsx works out of the box. Use tsx.
